# Anime-Project

# Anime Recommendation System:

This project presents an innovative anime recommendation system that employs machine learning techniques to suggest anime titles to users based on their preferences. Utilizing a content-based filtering approach, the system analyzes user-provided tags to recommend similar anime series or movies.

## Dataset Used:

The dataset foundational to the anime recommendation system was sourced from a comprehensive collection available on Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alancmathew/anime-dataset/data>).

This dataset provided a rich variety of information, including titles, genres, descriptions, and viewer ratings, which are essential for building a content-based recommendation system.

## Technology Stack:

**Python:** The primary programming language for data processing and model development.

**Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library used for implementing the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity computations.

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**SQL Developer:** The chosen database for storing and querying the processed data.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and exploratory data analysis.

## Data Model:

The system employs a content-based filtering data model, utilizing a TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data from anime tags and descriptions into a feature space. Cosine similarity measures provide the basis for calculating the likeness between anime titles, facilitating the recommendation process.

## Data Flow:

**Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources and compiling it into a raw data-set.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Normalizing, cleansing, and transforming data to prepare for analysis and modeling.

**Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF to transform text data into a weighted feature set.

**Model Training:** Applying cosine similarity to the TF-IDF vectors to train the model on the dataset.

**Recommendation Generation:** The system uses the trained model to predict and recommend anime titles based on a user's input tag.

**User Interaction:** Users interact with the system through a simple interface, receiving personalized anime recommendations.
